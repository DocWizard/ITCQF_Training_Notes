# Types of technical communication

* Technical writing
* Technical editing
* Graphic design
* UI design
* Information architecture
* Technical translation
* Technical training
* UX Usability

# Business value of technical communication

## Benefits:

>Organization : Well-documented product, comprehensive training materials, established processes, standards and responsibilities

>Employees: Better understanding of the product, faster implementation, ease of support for the customers, share knowledge

>Business: Reduced cost of implementation and support, improved customer satisfaction, reusable content for marketing

## Risks:

>Organization: Incomplete/lack of documentation, Unstructured, ad-hoc trainings, created on demand, not updated regularly

>Employees: Discovering the wheel over and over again, difficult introduction of newcomers, only 'gurus' can resolve issues, knowledge silos

>Business: High and unpredictable cost of implementation and support, customer dissatisfaction, dangerous legal and life consequences

# Information lifecycle

Plan -> Research -> Design -> Develop -> Review -> Publish -> Maintain -> Discard -> Plan...

(In theory - in practice, it's usually a huge mess.)

>[!CAUTION]
>**ITCQF says that documentation is not indispensible to release a product**

# The psychology of technical communication

Soft skills - communication, teamwork, empathy

Technical skills - intermediary between expert and end-users

Mindset - curiosity, patience, consistency

# Code of ethics as defined by ITCQF

Loyalty - public interest, clients, employers, co-workers

Quality - standards and product (speak up if something is wrong with the product)

Community - reputation, knowledge sharing (Tech writing community!)

Professionalism - independence and respect (Don't settle for half-measures)

Education - for others and ourselves

# Career paths in technical communication

![alt text](./IMG/careers.png)

>[!TIP]
>Lead vs manager as defined by ITCQF - The lead, as the head of a tech writing team, reports to the manager.
